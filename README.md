This repository demonstrates a common but easily missed bug in Python related to handling non-numeric values in calculations. The `calculate_average` function is designed to compute the average of a list of numbers.  While it correctly handles empty lists, it fails when the list contains non-numeric elements, causing a `TypeError`. The solution demonstrates how to robustly handle this issue using error handling.
